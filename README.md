## Setup Instructions

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. Follow the steps below to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

You can run the exploratory data analysis by executing:
```bash
python src/eda_analysis.py
```

To train the model and assess its performance, use the following commands:
```bash
python src/model_training.py
python src/model_evaluation.py
```

## Dataset Overview

The dataset utilized in this project is focused on customer churn and includes various attributes such as:
- `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `gender`: Gender of the customer
- `SeniorCitizen`: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
- `Partner`: Indicates if the customer has a partner (Yes/No)
- `Dependents`: Indicates if the customer has dependents (Yes/No)
- `tenure`: Duration in months that the customer has been with the company
- `PhoneService`: Indicates if the customer subscribes to phone service (Yes/No)
- `MultipleLines`: Indicates if the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No/No phone service)
- `InternetService`: Type of internet service (DSL/Fiber optic/No)
- `OnlineSecurity`: Indicates if the customer has online security (Yes/No)
- `OnlineBackup`: Indicates if the customer has online backup (Yes/No)
- `DeviceProtection`: Indicates if the customer has device protection (Yes/No)
- `TechSupport`: Indicates if the customer has tech support (Yes/No)
- `StreamingTV`: Indicates if the customer has streaming TV (Yes/No)
- `StreamingMovies`: Indicates if the customer has streaming movies (Yes/No)
- `Contract`: Type of contract (Month-to-month/One year/Two year)
- `PaperlessBilling`: Indicates if the customer has opted for paperless billing (Yes/No)
- `PaymentMethod`: Payment method (Electronic check/Phone check/Mailed check/Credit card)
- `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly billing amount for the customer
- `TotalCharges`: Cumulative amount billed to the customer
- `Churn`: Indicates whether the customer has churned (Yes/No)

## Model Development

The project includes scripts for training the machine learning model, located in `src/model_training.py`.

## Data Exploration

Data exploration activities are performed in `src/eda_analysis.py`, which includes:
- Loading and cleaning the data
- Generating summary statistics
- Visualizing customer churn and distribution of features

## Model Performance

After training, the model's performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score will be displayed in the console.
